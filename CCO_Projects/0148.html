          <h3>Catholic Technical School - Caloocan City, Philippines
          </h3>
          <p>Despite the fact that modern medical advances now allow us to cure Hansen’s disease (also known as leprosy), the
            social stigma surrounding the malady remains a problem, especially in developing countries like the Philippines.
            Even after the disease has been cured, the afflicted are still thought of as “lepers” and a risk to the community.
            <br />
            <br /> Completely healthy children and grandchildren who choose to join their relatives in the Tala Leper Colony find
            themselves separated from society and cut off from educational opportunities. The Franciscan Missionaries of
            Mary provide full scholarships for the young men of Tala to attend Don Bosco Catholic Technical School, in career
            fields such as automotive repair and electronics. Your gift can help cover tuition and room and board for students
            and potentially rescue an entire family from a lifetime of poverty.</p>
