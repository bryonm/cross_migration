          <h3>Feeding Program for Poor Boarding Students - Cotahuasi and Alca, Peru
          </h3>
          <p>For poor families in rural Peru, going to school requires an arduous walk from their mountain villages to the nearest
            big town. It can take several hours. As a result, many children stay home and never learn to read or write. The
            parents in these remote villages want a better life for their children, and Fr. Adrian Codevilla of the Order
            of the Incarnate Word has responded by offering very low-cost room and board near the schools.
            <br />
            <br /> At the mission’s Catholic boarding homes, the students do homework, receive tutoring, and are aided in their
            moral and spiritual formation, while receiving three nutritious meals a day. A gift from you will supplement
            the feeding program, and provide a home away from home for at least 100 students who are depending on our help.
          </p>
